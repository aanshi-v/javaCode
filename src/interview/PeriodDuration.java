/**
 * Quest:5.5- What is Period and Duration? When do you use them?
 * Quest:5.7- How do you find the difference between two dates in days or months? 
 * 
 * 1. Period â€” Date-based Amount of Time
Represents a quantity of time in years, months, and days

Works with LocalDate (which doesn't have time-of-day)

ðŸ“Œ Use When:
You are dealing with dates, e.g., age calculation, project deadline in months, etc.
___________________________________________________________

 2. Duration â€” Time-based Amount of Time
Represents a quantity of time in hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds

Works with LocalTime, LocalDateTime, or Instant (which include time)

ðŸ“Œ Use When:
You are measuring time duration, like how long a task took, session timeout, stopwatch, etc.
